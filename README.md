## Description

This project aims to perform sentiment analysis on social media data using machine learning techniques. The goal is to classify text data into positive, negative, or neutral sentiment categories. The project includes data preprocessing, feature extraction, model training, and evaluation. The trained model is saved for future predictions.

## Motivation

Social media platforms are a rich source of public opinion and sentiment, making sentiment analysis a valuable tool for businesses, researchers, and policymakers. By analyzing the sentiment of social media posts, we can gain insights into public opinion, track the impact of events, and monitor brand reputation. This project demonstrates how to build a sentiment analysis model that can be used for these purposes.

## Project Workflow

1. **Data Preprocessing**: Cleaning and preparing the text data for analysis.
2. **Feature Extraction**: Converting text data into numerical features that can be used by machine learning algorithms.
3. **Model Training**: Training a machine learning model to classify text data into sentiment categories.
4. **Model Evaluation**: Evaluating the performance of the trained model using accuracy metrics.
5. **Model Saving**: Saving the trained model for future use.
6. **Future Predictions**: Using the trained model to make predictions on new text data.
